Here we learn some basic understanding of how compiler / interpreter pipeline work. Just the rough idea but decent enough for further understanding of the topic.

General pipeline of a language (in place of terms compiler / interpreter) are :
1. Scanning / Lexing
2. Parsing
3. Static Analysis
4. Intermediate Representation
5. Optimisation
6. Code Generation
